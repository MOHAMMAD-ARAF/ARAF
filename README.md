EasyJet UK Limited was established in the UK, which is a British low-cost airline. Moreover, this is a good company in the UK and a subsidiary of EasyJet plc. In addition to that, people believe on the services of the company. However, it was founded in 2017 in the UK. This was started after the UK Government triggered Article 50. The company has provided the best services including quality and time to its respected customers. EasyJet is a popular company in the UK. The company has created a good image in less time in the whole world. However, it has suspended some services to specific places as well. The airline was founded in response to the UK's decision to leave the European Union and its preparation for potential Brexit scenarios. With three distinct air operator's licenses and bases in Austria, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, EasyJet is organized as a pan-European national airline. Thus, EasyJet plc is a pan-European airline group that consists of three airlines (easyJet UK, easyJet EU, and easyJet Switzerland), all of which are wholly or partially owned by easyJet plc, a UK-based company that is listed on the London Stock Market Exchange. The company has provided transportation services using more than 162 aircrafts as well.
